I am in search of and/or applying for master's programs in **data science** and/or **machine learning**. I am also currently interning at [Open Science Labs](https://opensciencelabs.org/), working on **open science**. I am a recent graduate from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) in Kenya, with a bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering.

I have previously worked with drone technology and embedded systems software engineering, back when I was interested in mechatronics. Most recently, I have been involved in research projects in **climate science**, **computational neuroscience**, **LLMs** and **healthcare**.

I am broadly interested in **open science**, **scientific computing** and **machine learning**, mainly in the context of **research**, and I am actively trying to pivot into these fields.
