I am an aspiring **data engineer**. Currently, I work on freelance projects and competitions in data science and ML, with some work involving open source ML communities such as Omdena and [Sisonke Biotik](https://www.sisonkebiotik.africa/). I have a bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) in Kenya.

In the past, I have worked with embedded systems software, drone technology, hardware design and the Internet of Things.

I am eager to apply my skills and grow as a data engineer, while contributing to impactful data-driven solutions.
