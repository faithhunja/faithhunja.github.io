I am in search of work opportunities and master's programs at the intersection of **data science** or **machine learning** and **science**. Currently, I work on freelance projects in data science and ML, with some work involving open source ML communities such as Omdena and [Sisonke Biotik](https://www.sisonkebiotik.africa/). I have a bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) in Kenya.

In the past, I have worked with embedded systems software engineering, drone technology and the Internet of Things. I am currently working on projects in **climate data science**.

I am broadly interested in research in **open science**, **scientific computing** and **machine learning**, and I am actively working towards pivoting into these fields.
