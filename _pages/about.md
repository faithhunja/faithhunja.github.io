I am in search of work opportunities at the intersection of research in **data science** or **machine learning** and **science**. Currently, I work on freelance projects in data science and ML, with some work involving open source ML communities such as Omdena and [Sisonke Biotik](https://www.sisonkebiotik.africa/). I have a bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) in Kenya.

In the past, I have worked with embedded systems software, drone technology, hardware design and the Internet of Things.

I am broadly interested in research in **open science**, **scientific computing** and **artificial intelligence**, and I am actively working towards pivoting into these fields.
