I am in search of internships and master's programs at the intersection of **data science** or **machine learning** and **science**. I currently work as an **open source** software developer intern at [Open Science Labs](https://opensciencelabs.org/), and as a volunteer researcher in ML for healthcare at [Sisonke Biotik](https://www.sisonkebiotik.africa/). I have also recently joined [Rim Nextgen](https://ke.linkedin.com/company/rimenergies) as the Chief Data Officer. I have a bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) in Kenya.

In the past, I have worked with embedded systems software engineering, drone technology and the Internet of Things. Lately, I have been involved in research projects in **geometry processing**, **climate science**, **computational neuroscience**, **LLMs** and **ML for healthcare**.

I am broadly interested in **open science**, **scientific computing** and **machine learning**, mainly in the context of **research**, and I am actively working towards pivoting into these fields.
